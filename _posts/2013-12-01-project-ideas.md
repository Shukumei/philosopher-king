This past week, our creative process was inconveniently interrupted by
Thanksgiving and familial obligations. Online collaboration has resulted in two
promising directions for the final project.

### Ideas:

#### R2D2 vs. Death Star

**Demo Theme:** In this game, R2D2 has unexpectedly learned to fly and shoot
lasers. With his newfound bravado, the little droid decides to challenge the
Death Star single handedly. 

**Potential Technical Features:**

 - Procedurally generated terrain for background planets, stars, and asteroids
 - Shape grammar for enemy ships, and potentially R2D2/Death Star
 - Bezier curves for R2D2â€™s flight path, possibly changing and becoming more
   difficult with advancing levels
 - Toon shading

 
#### Pretend You Can Fly: Exploring California

**Demo Theme:** Fly over a 3D map of California! Using USGS height map data, the
California landscape comes to life. Potentially with the ability to shoot things
unnecessarily.

**Potential Technical Features:**

 - Procedurally generated terrain. Using height map data, convert the California
   landscape to snow covered mountains, lakes, and generic ground covering to be
   determined later
 - Collision detection for those inconvenient mountain ranges

### Creative Efforts:

Zach has been looking into incorporating camera or user movement through the use
of his Google Glass. The project theme will be finalized within the next couple
of days.
 
This week, Zach has also been working on a few special tasks: improving his
immune system and not infecting the other members of the group.  We are
confident in his ability to perform these tasks well and promptly.
