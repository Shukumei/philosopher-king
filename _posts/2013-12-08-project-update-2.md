This week, we settled on our project (death star trench run) and divvied up the work.

As of now, we have decided on the following technical features:
 - Toon shading (targeting computer view mode) (2pts)
 - Procedurally modeled city (death star trench) (2pts)
 - Shape grammar (for the ships) (3pts)
 - Collision detection (2pts)

### What each of us have been doing this week:

#### Jake:
 - procedurally generating the trench
 - control/motion

#### Amy:
 - shape grammar
 - textures

#### Zach:
 - modeling shapes for use with the shape grammar (x-wing, y-wing, a-wing)
 - glass control
